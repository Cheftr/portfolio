              Data analytics is a computer science field that uses data to find patterns, trends, and relationships to
              solve problems and generate insights. It involves collecting, organizing, and transforming data to make
              predictions and informed decisions. Data analytics can help businesses grow, improve decision-making, and
              shape business processes.
